`main\dataset` -> Water and Elevation values map for each pixel [i, j]. For this one, `resize_borvo.csv` is used. Both values were extracted from `map_resize_borvo.ipynb`.

`main\europa_map\raw` contains the surface of europa images taken from NASA JPL documentation, except resize_borvo_mensa.jpg.
`main\europa_map\watered\watered_borvo_mensa.png` contains image of water generated map from resize_borvo_mensa.jpg original map. This image also processed on `map_resize_borvo.ipynb`

`main\hill_climb.ipynb` is where the horizon optimized hill climbing algorithm used to solve the problem, a.k.a reach maximum water value while minimize energy cost.

`main\simulated_annealing.ipynb` approach different solution to the problem.

The `.gif` files show how the algorithm is trying to solve the problem, generated by `visual_HC.ipynb` and `visual_SA.ipynb`
